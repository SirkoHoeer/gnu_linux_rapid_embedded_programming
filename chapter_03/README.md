=====================================================================

Here the code from chapter 3 - "C compiler, device drivers & useful developing
techniques" of the book "GNU/Linux Rapid Embedded Programming" written by
Rodolfo Giometti and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78646-180-3).

Here are some exmaples about how a kernel module works, an example of very
simple device driver and the code of a C interpreter we used in the book to
show how to use a compiler or a cross-compiler.
